# 🌟 Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews 📚🛍️

This repository contains the implementation of sentiment classification models for analyzing product reviews. We provide two Jupyter Notebooks: one using **FFNN** and the other using **BERT**. Each notebook produces one result file (.csv) during runtime. 🎯

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

Follow these steps sequentially to get started:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdmersonLow/IE4483-Project/
cd IE4483-Project
```

### 2️⃣ Prepare Your Data 📂

- Upload `train.json` and `test.json` datasets to your Google Drive.
- Connect your Google Drive to each notebook to access the files.

### 3️⃣ Run the Notebooks 📓

Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:

1. **`FFNN_Model.ipynb`**: This notebook trains and evaluates the FFNN-based sentiment classifier. It produces:
   - `FFNN_results.csv`

2. **`BERT_Model.ipynb`**: This notebook trains and evaluates the BERT-based sentiment classifier. It produces:
   - `BERT_results.csv`

🎉 Each notebook outputs one `.csv` file with the results.

## ✨ Additional Features

- **TF-IDF Features:** By default, the current implementation uses TF-IDF for feature extraction.
- **Playground Code:** Additional features such as **Word2Vec** and other embeddings (e.g., GloVe) are available in the playground section.

> 🔔 *Note: Please download GloVe embeddings separately if you wish to use them.*
